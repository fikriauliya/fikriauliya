- title: Building fikriauliya.com with Gatsby, Material UI & GraphQL
  tags: ["gatsby", "react", "graphql"]
  taskType: code
  comment: "Spend some times trying different UI framework. Started with Chakra-UI and ended up with Material UI. The
  reason is pragmatic: MUI provides the most complete components. Learned TailwindCSS, looks really handy (for those enjoying
  customizing CSS)"
