  comment: "It was fun, I thought static site generator can only generate boring site. It turned out it has GraphQL +
  file processor. So we can write notes in MD files, then during build time the preproccessor would
  collect (& filter + sort!) all those MD (in GraphQL syntax) and inject as props to React component"
