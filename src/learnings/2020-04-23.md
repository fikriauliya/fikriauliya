  comment: "This is super cool: https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui -> SQL Explorer in vim! It can help to
  remember connection strings, explore DB structure (without having to type queries as in SQL CLI), execute queries, 
  and also save the queries. 
  As it is inside vim, we can easily copy multiple query results into single buffer for analysis/text search/etc"
